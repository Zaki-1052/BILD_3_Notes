# BILD 3 Lecture 2
- ## 4/2

## Evolution via Natural Selection
### Objectives
- lineage and trait
- evolutionary tree
- homologies from convergent evolution
### Overview
#### Explanation
- in terms of natural selection, it's due to fitness, where a variety of traits exist in a population, and some of those traits in certain individuals will be more favorable to the environment than others. and over time, those individuals with those favorable traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, so the distribution of individuals from the population with those traits will increase over time and generations.
#### Evolution Notes
- Changes in the population's gene pool over generations 
- **Mutations** that can be inherited
- Traits that can make an individual more likely to survive or reproduce are more likely to be passed on to the next generation
	- need chance to pass on genes
- example:
- Traits like camouflage that help individuals evade predators increase their survival
	- live longer because don't get eaten
- --> more of next generation has that trait
- Only heritable (genetic) traits get passed on through biological inheritance
- Environments change, so selection changes too
- Some behavior is genetic
- how *common* a trait is in a population within a few generations
##### Convergent evolution and homology
- are they descended from a common ancestor with wings
- or do both their ancestors have wings
- Evolutionary tree: 
	- dragonfly, macaw, trout
```
Time -->
|--------dragonfly
|------|macaw|-----trout
```
- **Trait/character**:
	- something you can measure about the organism.
		- ex: \# of wings, toes; blood pressure
- time goes from the root to the tips
- every branch point in the tree is a common (shared) ancestor
- Branch points are **common ancestors** of the species "downstream" of the branch point
- every point is a species - map of ancestors - snapshot in time
- where along the lineage did powered flight evolve?
- **Lineage**:
	- line/tree (lecture vid: 11:35)
- slug: most recent common ancestor of macaws and dragonflies
- wings evolved separately
	- part of both dragonfly and macaw lineage
- when a trait evolves more than once due to different factors
	- **convergent evolution**
		- each lineage separately evolved this trait
- converged on this wing trait by different paths
- backbone:
	- dragonfly: no backbone
	- backbone: macaw & trout
- most **recent** common ancestor of macaw and trout
	- fish that had a backbone
	- where they first meet up
- not convergent: most common recent ancestor had trait
	- evolved from that MCRA
- **homology**
	- share the trait *because* of their common ancestry
- *convergence* and *homology* are **opposites**
- when both branches evolve trait = convergence
- homology = when trait from single ancestor point
- **homology** definition
	- when a trait is shared because of common ancestry

##### Convergent evolution and homology
- **definitions**:
- **Homologous trait**:
	- a trait that is shared between two species because both species inherited it from a common (shared) ancestor
		- examples: backbone in trout/macaw
		- Wings in macaw/hummingbird
- **Convergence trait**:
	- A trait that is shared between two species because it evolved multiple times.
	- The trait arose independently in both lineages.
		- examples: wings in macaw/dragonfly
