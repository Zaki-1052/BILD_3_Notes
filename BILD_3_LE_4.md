# BILD 3 Lecture 4
- ## 4/7

## Population Growth

- In rabbit paradise, this would produce **Exponential Growth**
#### Limits on population growth
- Rabbits do not actually live in rabbit paradise
- Limits on process: what reduces the number of rabbits in nature
- Predators
- Habitat loss
- Scarcity of resources - food, water, etc, space
- Reproduction of insufficient partners
- Disease
- Mutation -> allele not helpful, now harmful
- Natural disasters if bad, earthquake
- Population growth curves:
	- What will happen to this rabbit population in the long term?
		- Shrink to zero - possible
		- Cycle up and down - likely
		- level off - likely
	- cycle up and down or level off
- in real populations, more offspring are born than can survive and reproduce
- if all the offspring survived and reproduced:
	- 2 -> 19 mil elephants
- in every species, in every generation, many individuals die before ...
	- lecture vid
### Variation
- Do all individuals have an equal chance at surviving and reproducing?
- rabbit traits: 
	- fur color, size, speed, gait, jumping, teeth
- **Natural Selection**:
	- *Natural selection* happens whenever there is **variation** in a ==*heritable*== trait that affects *==survival== and/or ==reproduction==*
- natural selection is a filter
	- no individual rabbit got faster as a result
- speed helps survival
- Will the next generation of rabbits be faster as a result of natural selection in this generation?
	- Not enough information to tell
		- need to know whether the trait is heritable
	-
