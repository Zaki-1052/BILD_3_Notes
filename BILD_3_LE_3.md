# BILD 3 Lecture 3
- ## 4/4

## Overview
- *The pattern of evolution:*
	- **Descent** with **modification** and **divergence**
- how lineages change over time on an evolutionary tree
- Evolution is a **pattern** and a **process**
- Pattern:
	- Descent with modification and divergence
- Trait = character
- Character transition
- As lineages evolve through time, the species tend to:
	1) Look more similar to their modern descendants
	2) Become more different from one another
		- divergence
	3) Become more difference from the common ancestor of the group
	4) Diversify into more & more species
#### ***Evolution*** is a *pattern* and a *process*
##### **Pattern:**
- **Descent with modification and divergence.**
- As lineages evolve through time, they tend to:
	1) become more similar to modern species
	2) become more different from one another
	3) become more different from the common ancestor of the group
	4) diversify into more and more species
##### Process (ie mechanism)
- **Random** processes such as **mutation** and **genetic drift**
- **Natural selection** (**not** *random*)

- Together, these evolutionary processes
	- produce the pattern of descent with modification.
- Natural selection..
