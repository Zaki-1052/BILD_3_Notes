# Group 47

a) road kills and nests are inversely propotional
- nests increase over time, road kills decrease
b) normally distributed - greater wing length = greater % of birds = road kills
- at lower wing lengths less % of birds are road kills
- population of longer wings decreases
c) as time passes and wing length increases, road kill increases
- population and road kills inversely proportional
- birds that have a higher wing length are more likely to become wing length
- road kill less likely to survive and reproduce - not contributing to gene pool
- smaller wing lengths are being selected for
d) over time the population of cliff swallows is **increasing**
e) number of passenger vehicles **increases** over time at an exponential rate
- How has the number of cars in the US changed over time?

Yes, cars have imposed a selective pressure on swallows' wing length where a shorter wing length is being selected for. We know this because at lower wing lengths in graph B, a lesser proportion of birds are road kills, and so the population of longer wings is decreasing / being selected against. We also see from graph c that as time passes and wing length increases, road kill also increases, which means that birds with a higher wing length are more likely to become road kill, and thus less likely to survive and reproduce. 
Thus, via natural selection, they are not contributing to the gene pool as smaller wing lengths are selected for; we can see this in graph A, where as road kills increase, there are less nests; they are inversely proportional. Lastly, we can see that natural selection is decreasing the average wing length in order for the population to increase at the same time as the number of passenger vehicles is increasing. This means that the pressure of cars is selecting for smaller wing lengths over time.
