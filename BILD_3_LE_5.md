# BILD 3 Lecture 5
- ## 4/9

## Heritability

- Are some of these traits (heritable) genetic?
- What are some examples of heritable and non-heritable traits in humans?
	- hair/eye color
		- height is both heritable and environmental
	- non-heritable:
		- scars, tattoos, etc
	- language is environmental from family, not genetic
		- but it runs in families - cultural
- common garden experiment:
	- same environment, test whether heights are same
	- also twins
- If a trait is at least partly heritable, then offspring tend to be similar to their parents for that trait.
- The next generation tends to resemble the survivors of this generation.
- allele = variant of a gene
> [!Definition] Natural Selection
> Occurs when a particular version of a trait makes the individuals who have it more likely to survive and/or reproduce.
- Natural selection in this generation gave rise to a difference in the next generation.
> [!Definition]
> Change in a population's heritable traits or gene pool over time.
- If this trait were not heritable, natural selection would not affect the next generation
	- and evolution would not take place
> [!Concept] Natural Selection
> *Natural selection* happens whenever there is **variation** in a ==*heritable*== trait that affects *==survival== and/or ==reproduction==*
- Natural selection without evolution
- The frequencies of alleles change 
	- due to **genetic drift** by random chance/variation over generations
- fitness doesn't matter to evolution
- eye color - how common particular variants of a trait are
	- not natural selection or survival but still evolution
- Will the next generation of rabbits be faster as a result 
	- lecture vid!
- Evolution by natural selection is just math
- variation, survival, heritability
	- affects natural selection

## History of Evolutionary Thought

### Darwin's argument for natural selection
#### Observations
1. Members of a population often **vary** in their inherited traits
2. All species can produce more offspring than their environment can support, and many of these offspring fail to survive and reproduce
#### Inference
- Individuals whose inherited traits give them a higher probability of surviving and reproducing in a given environment tend to leave more offspring than other individuals
- This unequal ability of individuals to survive and reproduce will lead to the accumulation of favorable traits in the population over generations (*Evolution by natural selection; Adaption*)
### Darwin's theory of evolution
- Pattern:
	- Descent with modification and divergence
- Process (mechanism):
- *Random processes such as mutation and genetic drift*
- Natural selection (not random)
- How did Darwin come up with these ideas
