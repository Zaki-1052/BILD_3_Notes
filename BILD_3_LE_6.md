## History of Evolutionary Thought

- **The conventional wisdom in England and Europe at the time**
	- Each species were thought to have been created individually by God via "special creation."
	- Most scholars accepted that the earth was older than 6000 years, but it was unclear how old (a few million years?)
	- Paleontologists were finding fossils and documenting extinctions and changes over time.
	- Hints at the pattern (change over time), but not the process (natural selection).
- Q: Australia and Africa have been separate continents for about 120 million years.
	- Which do you predict would be **most similar** to 50-million-year-old fossils of Australian mammals?
		- Australian living mammals
- **Principle of Succession**:
	- Living organisms look similar to the fossils in their region.
	- This is because they are descended from those ancestors, with modification.
- Darwin observed biographical patterns that helped him figure out the theory of evolution

| Observation                                                                                                                      | Darwin later figured out                                                                                                                                 |

| Sloths and armadillos:<br>Modern species in a region resemble ancient species in that same region<br>**Principle of succession** | pecies are similar across time in a region because modern species are **descended with modification** from local ancestors.<br>Also: species go extinct. |
| Seashells in the Andes Mountains, rising coastline:<br>Earth changes slowly.<br>Earth is old.                                    | There has been enough time for many tree branchings (**divergence**) to create an enormous tree of life and all of modern biodiversity.                  |
|                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                          |
- The forces observable today can create the massive structures we see around us, given enough time.
- Therefore, **the Earth must be very old**
- If the Earth can change slowly, maybe life can too.
